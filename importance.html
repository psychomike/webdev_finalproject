                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">Although we often think of fungi as organisms that cause disease and rot food, fungi are important to human life on many levels. They influence the well-being of human populations on a large scale because they are part of the nutrient
                        cycle in ecosystems. They also have other ecosystem uses, such as pesticides.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="section-heading text-center">Various Applications</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
                    <h2>Biological Insecticides</h2>
                    <p class="text-faded">As animal pathogens, fungi help to control the population of damaging pests. These fungi are very specific to the insects they attack; they do not infect animals or plants. Fungi are currently under investigation as potential microbial
                        insecticides, with several already on the market. For example, the fungus Beauveria bassiana is a pesticide being tested as a possible biological control agent for the recent spread of emerald ash borer .</p>

                    <h2>Farming</h2>
                    <p class="text-faded">The mycorrhizal relationship between fungi and plant roots is essential for the productivity of farm land. Without the fungal partner in root systems, 80–90 percent of trees and grasses would not survive. Mycorrhizal fungal inoculants
                        are available as soil additives from gardening supply stores and are promoted by supporters of organic agriculture.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Nearly all plants have joined with saprophytic and mycorrhizal fungi in symbiosis. Mycorrhizal fungi surround and penetrate the roots of grasses, shrubs and trees, expanding the absorption zone by 10 to 100 fold, aiding in their quest
                        for water and increasing the moisture-holding capacity of soils. This close alliance also forestalls blights and is essential for longevity of the forest ecosystem. Throughout the life span of a Douglas Fir tree, nearly 200 species
                        of mycorrhizal mushrooms can be joined in this most holy of alliances. The interrelationships of these species with other organisms in the forest are just beginning to be understood. What we do know is that fungal complexity is
                        the common denominator of a healthy forest.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Unfortunately, the nearly 50% loss of mycorrhizal mushroom species in Europe forebodes of impending ecological collapse. With the loss of fungi, disease vectors soon plague the forest. The diversity of insects, birds, flowering plants
                        and indeed all mammals begin to suffer. Humidity drops, now exposed soils are blown away, and deserts encroach, stressing resources all the while human populations artificially expand beyond the carrying capacity of their resident
                        ecosystems.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Food and Nutrition</h2>
                    <p class="text-faded">Fungi figure prominently in the human diet. Morels, shiitake mushrooms, chanterelles, and truffles are considered delicacies . The meadow mushroom, Agaricus campestris, appears in many dishes. Molds of the genus Penicillium ripen many
                        cheeses. They originate in the natural environment such as the caves of Roquefort, France, where wheels of sheep milk cheese are stacked to capture the molds responsible for the blue veins and pungent taste of the cheese.</p>

                    <h2>Industrial</h2>
                    <p class="text-faded">Fungi have industrial applications as well and several of the 'model organisms' which enable our understanding of fundamental biology like genetics and development, are fungi. Entrepreneurs are applying fungi to provide sustainable
                        and biodegradable structural products such as building materials, packing materials, and even vehicle bumpers.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Many enzymes produced by fungi are valuable in the paper pulp industry, for bioremediation, and even for fashion: fungal enzymes are used to soften and fade denim jeans. Scientifically, the mould Neurospora crassa and the yeast Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae (brewer’s yeast) are model organisms used all over the world in basic and applied science laboratories. And, in 1996, Saccharomyces cerevisiae became the first eukaryote to have its genome sequenced.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Fermentation of grains to produce beer and of fruits to produce wine is an ancient art that humans in most cultures have practiced for millennia. Ancient humans acquired wild yeasts from the environment and used them to ferment sugars
                        into CO2 and ethanol under anaerobic conditions. It is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild yeasts from different wine-making regions. Louis Pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of brewer's yeast,
                        Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for the French brewing industry in the late 1850s .</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also know as baker's yeast, is an important ingredient in bread, a food that has been considered a staple of human life for thousands of years. Before isolated yeast became available in modern times, humans
                        simply let the dough collect yeast from the air and rise over a period of hours or days. A small piece of this leavened dough was saved and used as a starter (source of the same yeast) for the next batch, much in the same way sourdough
                        bread is made today.</p>

                    <h2>Medicine</h2>
                    <p class="text-faded">Many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance. Fungi naturally produce antibiotics to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, limiting their competition in the natural environment. Important antibiotics, such
                        as penicillin and the cephalosporins, can be isolated from fungi. Valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine (which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of
                        steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids used to stop bleeding. Psilocybin is a compound found in fungi such as Psilocybe semilanceata and Gymnopilus junonius, which have been used for their hallucinogenic properties by various cultures
                        for thousands of years.</p>


                    <p class="text-faded">As simple eukaryotic organisms, fungi are important model research organisms. Many advances in modern genetics were achieved by the use of the red bread mold Neurospora crassa. Additionally, many important genes originally discovered
                        in S. cerevisiae served as a starting point in discovering analogous human genes. As a eukaryotic organism, the yeast cell produces and modifies proteins in a manner similar to human cells, as opposed to the bacterium Escherichia
                        coli, which lacks the internal membrane structures and enzymes to tag proteins for export. This makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant DNA technology experiments. Like bacteria, yeasts grow easily in culture,
                        have a short generation time, and are amenable to genetic modification.</p>
